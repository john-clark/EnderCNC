## This RodMod version is just a fun little thing i made up to use some old 12mm rods i had laying around. Works really well though. 
### The "non-Ravenspecial" is Ender 3 PRO based, there are 2x rod on X axis and 3x rod on X axis versions in the CAD.  
### The "Ravenspecial" is my own machine, i used a CR 10 V2 and some other parts i had laying around. 
### You are free to make this version but any support for this version will be on a separate channel on our Discord. I dont know the BOM cost, these are just a side project.
