# EnderCNC's!

### Got too many Enders laying around? Dont need a [5th Trident?](https://github.com/yell3D/Ender3dent) Well! Try one of the EnderCNC's, born from a lack of sleep, a wish to learn more CAD and too many spare parts floating around.

## Current plan has changed a bit. There will be multiple versions of these.

### A [new cheaper version](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC) is now released!

- Based only on the Ender 3 PRO, where every part from the printer counts to keep the BOM cost very low. This will now be the Ender3CNC.
- As of now BOM cost is ~60$ not counting the Ender 3 PRO or dremel/spindle. But chances are you have some of the BOM laying around already.
- This version will include CAD for milling its own aluminium upgrades if it can handle it like the original version.

BOM and CAD will be released into "BETA" when CAD is "finished".


- The [original EnderCNC](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/EnderCNC%20CAD) underwent a facelift and is tested OK on parts and is now in "release" version and wont have updates unless issues arise. (this was loosely based on the Ender 3 PRO + Ender 4 parts)

### Other versions

- The MGN version will be based around the new Ender3CNC version, with minor tweaks to the frame layout resulting in a bigger cutting area.
- Mill style (MILO CNC) is also being worked on but might not be built unless i find more cheap Ender's. 

# Always check out the [Changelog](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNC/blob/main/Changelog.md) for any updates done to the CADs. 

Here are some videos from the original EnderCNC pre facelift using a 150W 20$ dremel.
