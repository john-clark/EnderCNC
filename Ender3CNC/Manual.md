# Ender 3 PRO based CNC Build manual (not finished)

### !! Note: This "guide" might contain errors with hardware parts, if you find any issue please let me know !!

## Things you'll need. 
- Ender 3 PRO (not the non pro version)
- M5 tap
- Ability to cut Alu extrusions to length.
- Hexdrives
- RaspberryPi or old laptop running linux/klipper. (if you want to use klipper)
- Dremel/Spindle of your choice (You might have to adjust the dremel clamps to fit yours)
- Printed pressfit pulley extraction tool (this can be tricky, but you can also cut the off if you want)

### Print settings I used: PLA+, 5 wall, 5 top, 5 bottom, 40% gyroid.

## Bearing Choice
### If you dont have 608Z use the F688Z from the Ender 3 Pro X axis tensioner.

## Blind Joints

### should be 20mm offset both front and back.

### What is this part? 
* This is the "X Endstop Buffer". It attaches to the X motor plate on the X endstop side to a heatinset.
* This "buffer" is needed if you are homing with the vacuum attachment or "splashguards" on to not collide in the Y extrusion.
* You will not need this attached if you are not using the vacuum attachment.
* M3x8/10 screw

# The build! 

### DO NOT PRESS IN THE ENDSTOPS AT ANY POINT UNTILL YOU START WIRING! YOU MIGHT NOT GET THEM OUT AGAIN AS THEY ARE PRESSFITS.

* DO NOT PRESS IN THE ENDSTOPS YET.
* Assemble frame as shown, take note of blind joints and 20mm offset on the back extrusion and check for square.
  - I found it easier to get a square frame on a known flat surface by adding the XY joints after the frame is built. Its a bit tricky, but very doable.

## Mount XY joints to the frame.

| 8pc  | V-Wheels     | Ender3         |       |
| 8pc  | M5 Locknuts  | Ender3 or BUY  |       |

* DO NOT PRESS IN THE ENDSTOP YET.
  - I slid the xy joint on while the frame was built.
  - Put on the 2 bottom wheels and loosely add M5 nut to them.
  - Place the bottom wheels in the V slot, hold it at a slight angle.
  - Add the 2 top wheels to the Vslot and angle up the XY joint with a slight wiggle the top screws should pop in the wheels.
  - Bit tricky but doable. Or if you want to just take of the 2040 from the frame and slide them on. Might need to re-square the frame though.
* After mounting both XY joints, doublecheck the measurement between the X extrusion mounting points before cutting the X extrusion.
* Ender 3 frames might not be 100% the same. so yours might be +- from 300mm.
* After cutting the X extrusion to size you need to tap 4 new m5 threads on the cut side.

* DO NOT PRESS IN THE ENDSTOP YET.
* Cut Ender3 2020 extrusions to 150mm x2 pieces.
* Tap m5 threads in both ends of the 150mm 2020 extrusions.
* Press in bearings if you didnt already.
* Loosely attach the coupler to the Z motor.
* Loosely attach the 20T pulley to the X motor. 
* Attach both Z and X motors to their plates before continuing.
* Attach the 2020 extrusions as square and paralell as you can.
* Mount the X motor carriage to the ZX carriage with the wheels and spacers.
  - This can be a bit tricky, but doable after picking up the wheels and spacers from the floor a few times, sorry.
  - NOTE! Alu spacers from the Ender 3 are 8.35mm long, if you use 8mm long spacers from another source please use this [add part link here] printed spacer part for the lower middle wheel.
* Attach the Z bottom bearing plate and Z motor plate.
* Attach the MGN12 rails with the MGN12H carriages to the 2020 extrusions. (use a printed MGN12->2020 tool to get good alignment on the rails. Printables, Thingiverse etc)
  - NOTE! If you cut the 2020 a bit shorter than 150mm or the rails you ordered/cut are over 150mm dont worry, in the Z motor plate there are cutouts for the MGN rails to slide into if they are too long (max 4mm clearance)
* Attach the Z leadscrew nut to the Z carriage.
* Mount the Z carriage to the MGN12H carriages. - After mounting the Z carrige to the rails, slide it up and down to check for any binding in the rails, adjust rails if needed.
* Cut leadscrew to size. ~180mm but doublecheck with your setup. it should just about poke out of the lower Z bearing.  
* Screw in the leadscrew from the bottom bearing all the way to the Z motor coupler and secure it.
* Slide the assembly on the X extrusion that was cut to size.

## Attach the Dremel clamp or Ø52-65mm clamp depening on what you use.

# Wires

### Now you can finally touch the limit switches. 

- Solder wires to 4x limit switches as you do for any 3d printer. If you are using wires with JST on the end, slide the wires into the wire holes for the endstop and then solders them to the limit switch.
- With the wires soldered on guide the limit switch into the hole and press it in, make sure it sits secure.
- If its too tight, lightly sand the faces of the limit switch and try again untill it fits.
- if its too loose use something to shim it tight or add a bit of hotglue to the hole then push the switch in.

## Electronics enclosure. 
- If you are using a 4.2.2/7 board or a SKR Pico there are housings for those with room for SSR on Printables. 
- You'll have to edit the part to fit a RPI if you use one. ( I use a old laptop running Ubuntu and klippers as a RPI)
- Any other enclosure/board setup you'll have to make something that fits your needs.

### PSU: You are on your own here for liability reasons, practice good safety.

## Machine should now be built and if everything feels smooth when moving it by hand you are good to start on firmware!

### Reference printer.cfg for klipper here. 

- For Klipper set everything up as you do with any 3D printer running klipper. Read the Klipper docs if you dont know how to.
- For GRBL base do the same according to your setup.
