### About This Project
Got too many Enders laying around? Don't need a [5th Trident?](https://github.com/yell3D/Ender3dent) Well! Try one of the EnderCNC's, born from a lack of sleep, a wish to learn more CAD and too many spare parts floating around.

## Current Versions

### Ender3CNC (Budget Version)
**[View Project Files](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC)**

This new cheaper version is now released! Based only on the Ender 3 PRO, where every part from the printer counts to keep the BOM cost very low.

**Features:**
* BOM cost approximately $60 (not counting the Ender 3 PRO or dremel/spindle)
* Chances are you have some of the BOM laying around already
* Includes CAD for milling its own aluminium upgrades if it can handle it like the original version

## The more expensive "bigger" brother of the E3CNC </div>

**Features**
* 12mm ROD and linear bearings
* slightly bigger cutting area
* leadscrews on all axis
* more rigid
* Can easily be modified to fit 8-16mm rods

### MGN Version (SoonTM)
The MGN version will be based around the new Ender3CNC version, with minor tweaks to the frame layout resulting in a bigger cutting area.
