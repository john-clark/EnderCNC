# 28.07.25

- Added new CAD version, no major changes yet, only updates to the BEEFY dremel clams, Ø52-65mm spindle clamps. 
- Removed old dremel clamp and old Z carriage from STL's. [still available in CAD]
- Added BEEFY version of the dremel clamp.
- Added new Z carriage for the BEEFY clamps [does not fit with the old dremel clamp]
- Removed faceplate from Printables, does not fit the new BEEFY clamps [Will come back soon]
- As always, there is no way for me to test the clamps on every “clone” of a dremel. You'll have to print a test and adjust as needed.
- Full credit to Shadowphyre for the new BEEFY dremel clamps. 


# 24.07.25
- Back after vacation !
- Added new electronics enclosure models, 15mm more clearance for wires. 
- Added new version of Z motor spacers, old ones could bend under warmer weather. There is a clean version, one with logo single color and one dual color logo version. Choose one and print 2 pieces. [Printables]
- Added new version of Z_top_bearing mounts for the new Z motor spacers. ( You do not have to reprint these if you want use the new Z motor spacers, only removed holes for the old spacers, should not be visible either way) [Printables]
- Added support for the Ender 3 NON-PRO using the 2040 from under the bed and not 4040 like the E3PRO. (will be uploaded soon with the new CAD version)


# 15.07.25

- Added STL's to the Printables page. 
- Ø65mm clamp added [untested, will be tested shortly] Should not remove any cutting area according to CAD.
- 4.2.2/SKR Pico+SSR enclosure added (will add mount for the underside of the machine later)
- 20mm “mod” front corners merged to main build. Old corners are still in CAD but has 20mm less cutting area on Y axis. 



# 29.06.2025
- Basic BOM listed. Please note that i might have not counted correclty. If you find any issues please let me know. BOM [here](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/blob/main/Ender3CNC/BOM.md)
- Added optional front corners, adding 20mm extra Y cutting area. No changes to BOM.
- These are not added to the main CAD yet. But you can find them [here](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC/Mods)
- Thanks Shadowphyre for the suggestion!


# 18.06.2025
- Macros for XYZ-0 positioning uploaded. 
- Tested out vac attachment, seems to do its job on wood, will test more on different materials. 


# 14.06.2025
- Had to wait for a new dremel as my new one was DOA. It arrived today, furter testing and cutting videos will be uploaded shortly!
- Will be testing differnt kinds of wood, some types of Plexi/acrylic and ofcourse some unknow grade aluminium. 


# 04.06.2025

### Ender3pro-CNC CAD uploaded!
- Fully built by me and a "beta" tester. Everything should fit nicely and easy enough to assemble!
- Build guide still not 100% finished, but it should give most pointers that you need
- Build guide and CAD is found ["HERE!"](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC)
- If you need .step contact me on Discord: ravenkeeper (filesize too big to upload)


# 05.05.2025

### There will be multiple versions as time goes on. 
- Facelift version of the EnderCNC is in "release" stage, CAD wont be updated unless issues arise during use. 
- New Ender3CNC version soon in "BETA". Base 99% on the Ender 3 PRO. Cheaper alternative on vwheels etc.

Picture of the new version.

# 28.04.25

Facelift version built, will do minor tweaking to CAD, but everything fits like it should. New CAD will be uploaded soon.



# 26.03.25

* Uploaded facelift version CAD. This version is tested OK, does alu with a dremel pretty nicely if you know how to tune your DOC, feeds and speeds.

# 20.03.25

* Udated CAD file. Added new look to the XY joints as the original was kinda lacking in the looks department. Added both dual bearing and single bearing version. (if you want the original one they are also in the CAD) 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c28c7d-b4e1-4f66-945f-cb4537701f71)

* Relocated the X endstop to be in-set into the LEFT XY joint.
- (Wires coming out on the other side where the wire loom connects to the XY joint)

* Comparison old vs new.

# 19.03.25

* Added belt tension system for the Y belts on the Y motor carriages.
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5478c03-ce43-4771-a19f-6c389b5a7d62)

* Added "splash-guards" to limit debris from spilling over to the Y axis belts and rods. ( need to cut them in half in slicer unless you have a 400mm printer )
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277b22a7-b80d-45ae-b5ac-68bf7e713d5e)
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d0ba5f0-c7e6-4111-8ce4-698545a82e9a)

* Maktia 700 series ( or other Ø65mm spindle ) clamp added.
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3a088d-0fb5-4ece-8c02-d77362ae9d74)

* Remixed Z carriage for more Z travel. But you'll have to cut the teethed part off a 8mmID 20t pulley, or use another 8mmID locking nut on the Z leadscrew. (lower 20t pulley cut to size on picture below)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7245a7b-c5ac-42ec-849a-a8e3474557ab)


* Bigger holes for ziptie cable management.
* Several fixes to the XY joints:
  - Fixed so the X carriage cant home over the Y extrusion.
  - Shorter screws for the Y belt clamps.
  - Longer XY joints with 55mm + 29mm LM bearings for more stability (optional)
  - You can now use either LMK10LUU or LMK10LUU + LM10UU for the XY joints. Using LMK+LMU does not reduce cutting area.


# 02.01.25

* Added 8mm rod mod CAD, using 8mm rods and 2x LMU8 bearings on each side for stiffness. (45mm long x2)


# 22.12.24

* Updated CAD with most of the hardware. Still a little bit left.
* Updated CAD X travel/limit switch for Z to not crash into Y extrusion if X homing without Z homed first. 


# 21.12.24

* Create Github
* Added CAD files
* Added DXF / PDF file of x gantry back plate.
