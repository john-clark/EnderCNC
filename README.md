### About This Project
Got too many Enders laying around? Don't need a [5th Trident?](https://github.com/yell3D/Ender3dent) Well! Try one of the EnderCNC's, born from a lack of sleep, a wish to learn more CAD and too many spare parts floating around.

## Current Versions

### Ender3CNC (Budget Version)
**[View Project Files](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC)**

This new cheaper version is now released! Based only on the Ender 3 PRO, where every part from the printer counts to keep the BOM cost very low.

**Features:**
* BOM cost approximately $60 (not counting the Ender 3 PRO or dremel/spindle)
* Chances are you have some of the BOM laying around already
* Includes CAD for milling its own aluminium upgrades if it can handle it like the original version

### Original EnderCNC
**[View Project Files](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/EnderCNC%20CAD)**

The original EnderCNC underwent a facelift and is tested OK on parts. Now in "release" version and won't have updates unless issues arise. This was loosely based on the Ender 3 PRO + Ender 4 parts.

### MGN Version (Coming Soon)
The MGN version will be based around the new Ender3CNC version, with minor tweaks to the frame layout resulting in a bigger cutting area.
