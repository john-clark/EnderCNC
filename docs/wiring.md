## 2. Limit Switch Installation

1. Solder wires to all 4 limit switches.  
2. Insert switches into the press-fit slots in the frame.  
3. Test that switches sit securely:
   - If too tight → lightly sand faces.  
   - If too loose → add shims or a small amount of hot glue.  
4. Leave switches **unpressed** until the frame and carriage are fully installed.

## 3. Wire Management

1. Use zip-tie mounts for clean wire routing.  
2. Keep wires away from moving parts.  
3. Route motor, limit switch, and spindle wires neatly to the electronics enclosure.

## 4. Electronics Enclosure

1. Choose enclosure based on your board (Raspberry Pi, SKR Pico, 4.2.2, 4.2.7).  
2. Modify enclosure if necessary to fit additional components like SSR.  
3. PSU installation:
   - Only connect once wiring is fully complete.  
   - Practice safety and follow electrical guidelines.

### Warnings

!!! warning
    Do not power the machine before completing wiring and verifying all connections.

!!! tip
    Use an old laptop running Klipper as an alternative to a Raspberry Pi if needed.
